# TO-DO:
# rework format_team_stats
# add arg to player_stats (include --all option)

# add total team kills, total team deaths, team K/D, etc to session_stats

# keep track of running stats
# most kills in one game (individual and team)
# most deaths in one game (individual and team)
# most damage in one game (individual and team)

# add more stats (damage taken, headshots, assists)
